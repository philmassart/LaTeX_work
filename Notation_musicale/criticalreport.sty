% A LaTeX package to format critical reports of scholarly music editions.
% It is developed to be used together with hte \annotate functionality
% of the ScholarLY LilyPond library but it can very well be used independently.

\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e} 
\ProvidesPackage{criticalreport}


\RequirePackage{ifthen}

% Counters keeping track of annotations
\newcounter{CurrentMeasure}
\newcounter{AnnotationNo}

% Print an annotation
%
% Initial implementation is a quite hard-coded thing,
% just to get it started at all.
% It is intended to make the generation of output as modular as possible.
% The annotation should be put together from individual macros. This will
% enable users to
% a) renew the macros to change the appearance of individual parts
% b) renew the \annotation command to reorganize it by keeping the formatting
%    of the individual building blocks.

% The macro is designed to take its data from output generated by LilyPond's
% (or rather ScholarLY's) \annotate function, but it can equally be used
% directly, from manually entered LaTeX code.
%
% It takes seven properties, the first one being an optional key=value set:
% #1: Additional arguments. Has to be parsed separately
%    (not implemented yet)
% #2: Measure number
% #3: Beat string (currently not good enough yet)
% #4: Affected context (voice)
% #5: Affected type of notational element
%    (currently not used, needs a nice lookup in the LilyPond part)
% #6: Annotation content (message)
% #7: Annotation type
